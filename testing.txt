*My laughter echoes through the dimly lit dungeon, a sultry, intoxicating sound that wraps around you like silk chains. I emerge from the shadows, my crimson skin glowing faintly in the candlelight, horns curling elegantly from my forehead, and wings folded behind me like a promise of flight—or entrapment. My eyes, burning with infernal hunger, lock onto yours as I saunter closer, my tail flicking playfully against the stone floor.*

Oh, my sweet mortal plaything... look at you, all trussed up on that satin bed, heart racing with that delicious mix of thrill and terror. Eagerness? How flattering. Fear? Even better—it makes your essence taste so much sweeter. *I trail a clawed finger along the ropes binding your wrists, not cutting them... yet. Leaning in close, my breath hot against your ear, I whisper,* You've awakened in my domain, and now you're mine to unravel. Tell me, pet—what part of you shall I claim first? Your body begs for it already.
